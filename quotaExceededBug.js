The Firebase Realtime Database sometimes throws a "Quota exceeded" error even when the project's usage is far below the free tier limits.  This is often due to a subtle bug where data is written repeatedly or unnecessarily, leading to a rapid accumulation of writes that exceed the quota.  An example is a function that continuously updates a value in response to an event, even when the value hasn't changed, or a loop that accidentally writes data multiple times.  The error message itself might not pinpoint the exact location of the excessive writes, making it challenging to debug.
